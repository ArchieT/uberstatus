# Uberstatus

![](doc/uberstatus.gif)

Status line generator for i3wm and (eventually) other WMs

Goals:

* integrate most of core functionality directly (checking cpu, network etc. without extra forking
* Support push and pull (polling) type of plugins
* Async (each plugin on its own timer) and sync mode with optional low power/slow update (WIP)

# Installation

    $ go get github.com/mattn/gom
    $ make
    downloading github.com/op/go-logging
    downloading gopkg.in/yaml.v1
    downloading github.com/VividCortex/ewma
    # Hack around go's retarded way of dealing with "global" package naming
    mkdir -p _vendor/src/github.com/XANi
    ln -s . _vendor/src/github.com/XANi/uberstatus >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
    gom exec go build -ldflags "-X main.version=0.0.1-0-gfbdadf3" [a-z]*go
    go fmt


# Operation

Each of plugins operates asynchronously and can send update of its status at any time. On each plugin update state is sent upstream (including previous cached plugin state) so it is possible to have each plugin update separetely.

Each plugin have a name (by default plugin name) and instance (in case of plugins that will be used multiple times, like network interfaces).


# Plugins

All plugins have `interval` option defining refresh rate in miliseconds

## CPU

## Clock

Parameters:

* `long_format`/`short_format` - time format, as golang formatting string
* `interval` - update interval in miliseconds. Note that it can be longer than it because of run time so for update every second something like 990 ms is better

## Disk free

```yaml
    - name: disk-root
      instance: df
      plugin: df
      config:
       prefix: "ðŸ’¾"
       mounts:
         - /
         - /var
         - /home
```

`prefix` will be added at beginning of the status bar. name and instance are just to distinguis between different instances

## Network

Parameters:

* `iface` - interface to use

## I3blocks

i3blocks-compatible input. It will also pass events in compatible way so plugins like volume can be used

Parameters:

* `command` - command to run
* `prefix` - prefix command with text

Example:

```yaml
    - name: volume
      plugin: i3blocks
      config:
        command: /usr/share/i3blocks/volume
```
